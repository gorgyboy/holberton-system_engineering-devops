In this project we're going to create several scripts to learn how
to use the shell and scripting proficiently.

### Scripts

- 1-listit: Displays the contents list of your current directory.

- 2-bring_me_home: Changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.

- 3-listfiles: Displays current directory contents in a long format.

- 4-listmorefiles: Displays current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .) using the long format.

- 5-listfilesdigitonly: Displays current directory contents in long format, with user and group IDs displayed numerically and hidden files (starting with .).

- 6-firstdirectory: Creates a directory named holberton in the /tmp/ directory.

- 7-movethatfile: Moves the file "betty" from /tmp/ to /tmp/holberton.

- 8-firstdelete: Deletes the file "betty" that is in /tmp/holberton.

- 9-firstdirdeletion: Deletes the directory holberton that is in the /tmp directory.
